## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Open, collaborative research is a powerful paradigm that can immensely strengthen the scientific process by integrating broad and diverse expertise.
However, traditional research and multi-author writing processes break down at scale.
We present new software named Manubot, available at <https://manubot.org>, for open scholarly writing.
Manubot adopts the contribution workflow used by many large-scale open source software projects to enable collaborative authoring of scholarly manuscripts.
With Manubot, manuscripts are written in Markdown and stored in a Git repository to precisely track changes over time.
By hosting manuscript repositories publicly, such as on GitHub, multiple authors can simultaneously propose and review changes.
Publication with Manubot is continuous:
When a manuscript's source changes, the rendered outputs are rebuilt and republished to a web page.
Manubot automates bibliographic tasks by implementing citation by identifier, where users cite persistent identifiers (e.g. DOIs, PubMed IDs, ISBNs, URLs), whose metadata is then retrieved and converted to a specified style.
Manubot modernizes publishing to align with the ideals of open science by making it transparent, reproducibile, immediate, versioned, collaborative, and free of charge.
Yet, fully open manuscript preparation also presents new challenges, which we faced while orchestrating Manubot's first use case: an open review article with {{deep_review_authors}} authors.
We discuss solutions to these challenges that arise with next-generation scholarly publishing.
