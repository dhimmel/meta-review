# Deep Review contribution stats & visualization

The notebooks in this directory rely on the `contrib-viz` conda environment, which can be installed using:

```sh
conda env create --file environment.yml

# activate environment
conda activate contrib-viz
```

The environment was updated to be compatible with Binder after the notebooks were originally run.
